                                            <p>Upon creation, a workbook is inactive. You must activate the workbook before you can use it as your workspace.</p>
                                            <p>Logging in and out of <span class="GeneralGUIName1">Xcalar Design</span> does not affect the state of a workbook. However, if the <span class="GeneralProductName3">Xcalar</span> cluster is stopped and then started again, all workbooks become inactive, and you must activate them again before working on your data.</p>
                                            <p>You do not need to deactivate one workbook to activate another. Multiple workbooks can be active at the same time. However, you can have only one browser tab for each active workbook. For example, you cannot display the same workbook in two browser tabs.</p>
                                            <p>You can activate multiple workbooks at the same time, provided that they are displayed in different browser tabs. You do not need to wait for the activation of one workbook to complete before activating another one.</p>

Therefore, if the cluster is low on memory, deactivate workbooks that you are not currently using. However, be aware that re-activating a workbook takes longer than switching from one active workbook to another. During activation, <span class="GeneralProductName3">Xcalar</span> might re-create the datasets and active tables, which might take a while, especially if the tables were created with complex operations.</div>

The following list describes possible scenarios where you want to download a workbook:</p>
                                            <ul>
                                                <li value="1">Handing off a workbook to other users:&#160;After performing interactive modeling on data from a data source, you can download the workbook and give it to other  users, who can use it in one of the following ways:<ul><li value="1">Use the workbook as a template to build a similar data pipeline.</li><li value="2">Continue modeling from the dataflows in the workbook.</li></ul></li>

Because the downloaded workbook contains all the relevant workbook information, such as UDFs and Jupyter Notebooks, it serves as a copy of the workbook to which you can revert if needed.</li>

                                            <p>The unpacked contents of the workbook file are in open and accessible formats, such as Python and JSON. The following items are included in the workbook file:</p>

This is because each batch dataflow, upon creation, is put in a global namespace, which is accessible to all users on the <span class="GeneralProductName3">Xcalar</span> instance.</p>
