Recipient shall take the same degree of care that it uses to protect its own confidential and proprietary information and materials of similar nature and importance (but in no event less than reasonable care) to protect the confidentiality and avoid the unauthorized use, disclosure, publication or dissemination of the Confidential Information.  Recipient shall not make any copies of the Confidential Information unless otherwise approved in writing in advance by Discloser.  Any such copies made shall be identified as the property of Discloser and marked “confidential,” “proprietary” or with a similar legend.

The obligations of this Agreement, including the restrictions on disclosure and use, shall not apply with respect to any Confidential Information to the extent such Confidential Information: (a) is or becomes publicly known through no improper act or omission of Recipient; (b) was rightfully known by Recipient before receipt from Discloser; (c) becomes rightfully known to Recipient without confidential or proprietary restriction from a source other than Discloser that does not owe a duty of confidentiality to Discloser with respect to such Confidential Information; or (d) is independently developed by Recipient without the use of or reference to the Confidential Information of Discloser.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the restrictions on disclosure and use shall not apply to (i) the specifications of the Licensed Products or to the extent (ii) approved by Discloser or (iii) Recipient is legally compelled to disclose such Confidential Information; provided, however, that prior to any such compelled disclosure, Recipient shall give Discloser reasonable advance notice of any such disclosure and shall cooperate with Discloser in protecting against any such disclosure and/or obtaining a protective order narrowing the scope of such disclosure and/or use of the Confidential Information
